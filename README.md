# firefly-server

Web app based off of Haskell [FireFly](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/firefly)

Firefly is dead simple http framework written in Haskell.

It strives for simplicity in implementation (and in use). It's great for people learning Haskell, fiddling with Monads, or who just need a really simple server for something.
